## About

In this repository, are build scripts for some game recreations. Proprietary assets are required to run them (*Unlike* the other repository I made with build scripts for games with free assets which can be found here https://github.com/publicsite/GamesRenovation ).

## Useage

clone the repository and cd to a directory. There are some numbered scripts. Start from number 1 and work your way up through the scripts in order to get build the recreations and run them.

Some of the unsuccessful attempts can be found in the ATTIC directory.
