Surreal engine does not recognise my unreal directory

I asked at https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine/issues/110

The SETUP.EXE file crashes using wine. I also tried setting windows 95 compatibility with winecfg and setting cwd using firejail.

Installer didn't go.

I tried extracting with 7z and unshield. It didn't go.
